== Root view ==

The ASF facelet view should contain at the root of the component tree a `UIView` element represented by the `f:view` XML element.  The main facelet file could therefore start with the following tag:

{{{
<f:view contentType="text/html"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:c="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core"
	xmlns:u="http://code.google.com/p/ada-asf/util"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <link media="screen" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="#{contextPath}/themes/main.css"/>
    <title>Volume Cylinder</title>
</head>
<body>
   ...
</body>
</html>
</f:view>
}}}

The `contentType` attribute allows to control the HTTP Content-Type header that will be returned in the response.  The `xmlns` attributes indicates the namespaces that are used by other ASF components in the view.

When ASF restores the view associated with the facelet file, it will create a `UIView` component that will hold the complete view.  The `f:view` node can hold HTML element as well as specific ASF or application components.
